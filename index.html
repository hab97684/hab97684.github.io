<h4 STYLE="color:Blue;">Why The Panthers Will Win the Super Bowl

<p> First off I just want to say the last loss was a <span STYLE="font-style:italic">fluke</span>. This team is better than that 
52-21 loss. The Steelers caught us at a bad time coming off a short week. The defense does
worry me a little bit, but I know they have the talent to be a top 5 defense. Our new
defensive coordinator has some issues to sort out with his game planning, but he's been
in the system long enough, so hopefully that will help him get everything together. Below I
will out line the 3 reasons the Panthers will be just fine and maybe have a shot at winning 
it all. </p> 
<ol style="1">
<li> Cam Newton is playing at an MVP level. He has never played this good to start the 
season in his whole career. If he can continue, the Panthers will be tough to beat.</li>
<li> The defense has the play makers to be elite. We saw this defense in a few games this year (i.e
the Bucs, Cowboys, and Bengals) they just have to show up a little more often. </li> 
<li> Finally, most of our players from the 2015 Super Bowl team are still there, so we have 
the experience to get there and win it.</li>
